						<h1>Brandon Craig</h1>
						<p><h4>My name is Brandon Albert Craig and here is a little bit more about who I am and what are my ambitions. I'm twenty-five year old and I was born on May 16, 1990 and I am the oldest of two children. I grew up in the Roseland neighborhood in which I came up in a fatherless home with my mother, grandmother and my younger sister. I am a very focused individual that made bad choices in the past but I am in the right mindset and have the motivation to show that a very successful person can come from very high crime rated area without having a father figure in my life. I graduated from a charter high school called C.I.C.S. Longwood Academy and it has prepared me to dressed professional and to get in the right mindset of adulthood. After Longwood, I went to Robert Morris University and studied Computer Sciences while I was there, but unfortunately due to my grades being bad and my financial aid situation I was unable to attain my degree. So, I had to get a job working for Strack & Van Til in Indiana for two years and those were the hardest two years of my life because of me being the minority and the amount of work that was being thrown at me. I got the news that the store would be closing down and I was in a bind because I was unable to find a job after that. Then, I heard about the Year-Up program from a friend and it brought back the motivation, drive and determination to become the person that I should have been years ago. My future goals that I want to accomplish would to become a cyber security agent for the NSA. This work deals with hacking and security for the United States as a whole. This  is my goal because it is a very rewarding field and it has room for advancement. Also, it can provide me the a career that I can enjoy doing rather than to go to a grocery store that I hated to go to. This is a basic sum up of who I am and what I want to become in life.

						<h1>Candace Kilgore</h1>
						<h4>My name is Candace Kilgore, I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago. I was born January 20,

1990. I am twenty-five years old. I have a beautiful three year old daughter, her name is Kennedy.  I 

graduated from Simeon Career Academy in 2008.  I am a current Year Up Chicago, Class 10 student. I 

love working with computers, doing puzzles, and being a mother. I also currently work in a call center as 

a Quality Assurance Associate. I like to spend my time learning about different technologies and 

expanding my knowledge. Throughout my life I was taught you have work hard for what you want and in 

doing so it helped me develop a strong work ethic. In 2012 my mother passed away a couple weeks 

before my daughter was born, which was the most devastating thing I had ever experienced. Although I 

was heartbroken, this made me want to strive to better in honor of her and prove to myself that I could 

achieve the goals she may have wanted me to achieve.</h4>
